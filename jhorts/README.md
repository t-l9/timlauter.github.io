###Objective###
Create a simple app that interfaces with a public open API (http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory).  The app should utilize an interaction pattern, such as user input/button, geolocation, etc., to pass information to the API, and with returned data, create content on the page.


Structure your app as you see fit. Connect to the API via xmlhttprequest, $.ajax, angular resource, or whatever you are most comfortable with. Use any framework, and any structure to your app, but be prepared to justify your selection.
